"""kbshot — screenshot an object on screen, picked with the keyboard.

Press the hotkey, and every screenshot-worthy thing on the focused monitor gets a
labelled box: windows, text blocks, paragraphs, lines, and non-text UI rectangles
(cards, images, buttons). Type the label, get that region on the clipboard. The
mouse is never involved.

The picker UI is wl-kbptr's `floating` mode, which takes arbitrary candidate areas
on stdin (`WxH+X+Y`, output-local logical coords) and prints the chosen one. Its own
built-in `source=detect` is deliberately NOT used: it filters out anything taller
than 50px or wider than 500px because it is hunting click targets, which is the
exact opposite of what a screenshot wants.

# firmware (~/Projects/zmk-config-corne/config/totem.keymap) and the laptop's
# built-in keyboard does it in kanata (modules/core/kanata-homerow.nix) -- and both
# put hold-tap home-row mods on the same letters: o/n = Super, e/t = Alt,
# i/h = Ctrl, plus s and z as layer-taps on the TOTEM.
#
# Those eight letters are excluded, because a label's first character is by
# definition typed after a pause. ZMK's `require-prior-idle-ms` and kanata's
# `key-timing less-than 200` guards both only suppress the hold behaviour when a
# key was pressed recently, so they protect the *second* character of a label but
# not the first. Worse, `hml`/`hmr` use positional hold-tap keyed on the opposite
# hand, so a slightly-slow first char followed by an opposite-hand second char is
# exactly the shape that resolves to a modifier -- turning a label into Alt+key
# instead of a selection.

# The colour that matters most is `fill`, and the reason is not aesthetic. wl-kbptr
# paints the label text straight onto the area rectangle with no backing of its own
# (mode_floating.c fills with selectable_bg_color, strokes a 1px border, then
# cairo_show_text on top). So the label's contrast is the contrast of the label
# colour against *whatever was already on screen*, attenuated by the fill's alpha.
# At the old fill alpha of 0x22 -- 13% -- white text over a white article page was
# effectively white on white. Every palette here therefore uses a near-opaque fill,
# which costs nothing: the anchor is only 46x30 logical px, so it hides a
# thumbnail-sized patch of screen and buys a guaranteed contrast ratio.
#
# Colour format is wl-kbptr's own #rrggbbaa (config.c parse_color; 8 digits, alpha
# last). Contrast ratios below are WCAG 2.1 against the fill, computed in
# tests/test_contrast.py rather than asserted here.

    same pixels. So the areas passed to wl-kbptr are not the regions -- they are
    fixed-size anchors at each region's top-left corner, like Vimium's link hints.
    Uniform anchor height also means one readable font size for every element, however
    small.

    When a candidate has no free slot near its corner, it is *grouped* onto the anchor
    it would have collided with rather than dropped -- 200 tiny elements in one corner
    cannot each own a readable label, and dropping them would break being able to
